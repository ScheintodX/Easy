Easy XFWM$ Theme
===============================================================================

A typographic reinvention of the Plain theme for UHD / hidpi displays.

This theme can be used as a template for your own theme. All files needed
to build it are included.

Building
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need python3, graphics-magick and inkscape.

There is one *xfwm.svg* which includes everything to generate all the graphics.

*conf.json* is used to define where the template is cut.

*make all* generates a *xpm.Makefile* using this config and runs it.
